  1. tty core
     control both the flow of data across a tty device and the format
     of the data.
  2. tty drivers
     focus on handling the data to and from the hardware.
     cannot directly communicate with the line discipline, doesn't
     realize it is present. 
  3. tty line discipline drivers
     format the data received from a user or the hardware, in a
     specific manner. such as protocol conversion such as PPP or
     Bluetooth. 

  总共有三种不同类型的tty设备：console, pty and serial port. console和
  pty内核已经实现了，新的tty设备一般是serial port类型的。
